// phase2-e2e.mjs — real-browser end-to-end for the extension's DISPLAY.
//
// Loads extension/ UNPACKED into Chrome for Testing via a Playwright persistent
// context, then drives the united.com / Navan content script and reads the
// panel/badges it actually renders.
//
// DETERMINISM (Round-18 P2): the Starlink tracker is no longer contacted live.
// Every tracker endpoint (/mcp, /api/predict-flight, /api/plan-route) is
// FULFILLED from a fixed per-case fixture, so odds are constant run-to-run and
// the gate no longer breaks when a live percentage drifts (68% vs 71%). United
// and Navan document requests are fulfilled locally too, so neither real site is
// ever hit. A negative-control mutation (E2E_NEG=1) reintroduces a known
// regression into a temp COPY of the extension and must make the gate exit 1.
//
// POLITENESS + SAFETY, by construction:
//   · united.com / app.navan.com are never really contacted (context.route
//     FULFILLS with a local fixture) and neither is the tracker.
//   · Playwright resolves from ~/.wo-respo/node_modules; nothing is added here.
//
// Output: test/out/phase2-report.md + screenshots in test/out/shots/.

         waits against ONE 35 000 ms budget and then report the expiry as a
         product failure.
         The signature was self-contradicting, which is what gave it away: a
         failing run recorded `highScoreFloatedTopAfterLateBatch:false` and then,
         on the very next line, `firstFlightIsUA6026:true` from orderProbe. The
         reranking had worked. The OBSERVATION had expired. Pass and fail on the
         same committed bytes is what the auditor measured, and this is the why.
         The pre-click precondition above only requires >= 2 scored badges, which
         batch one alone satisfies. So the click can land while batch two, the
         batch that carries UA6026, is still outstanding, and batch two's whole
         worker round-trip then has to fit inside the budget that was meant to
         measure the rerank. On a loaded machine it does not.
         The wait is therefore split, and each half now measures exactly one
         thing:
           A. the late batch ARRIVED. UA6026 is the only row predicted 0.90, so
              a badge reading 90% is that arrival and nothing else.
           B. the panel then RERANKED, on a budget that starts only once A has
              been observed.
         A slow worker can no longer eat the rerank budget, and a product that
         genuinely fails to rerank still fails B. Both are asserted, so a failure
         NAMES which half broke instead of collapsing into one boolean.
         Deliberately NOT fixed by raising 35000: a bigger number hides the race
         instead of removing it, and leaves the two waits sharing one budget. */

         container walk.
         The first repeat-proof run after the phase split (1 Aug 2026, 15:58 UTC)
         failed with `lateBatchArrived:true`, `highScoreFloatedTopAfterLateBatch:
         false` and `firstFlightIsUA6026:true`. That disconfirmed the arrival
         hypothesis outright — the batch HAD landed — and isolated the real
         fault: the two probes disagreed about the same DOM at the same instant.
         They disagreed because they were never the same probe. `orderProbe`
         anchors on `.usl-badge, .usl-metrics` and reads HOST text only,
         deliberately stripping every `usl-*` element. The inline waiter anchored
         on `.usl-badge` alone and read raw `textContent`. When the decision
         strip's own badge precedes the first row badge in document order, the
         inline walk climbs the PANEL, never reaches the row-list container —
         which is a sibling, not an ancestor — and so returns false forever while
         the list underneath is correctly reranked. Whether the strip renders
         first is a race, which is precisely how one committed set of bytes
         produced both a pass and a fail.
         The wait therefore polls `orderProbe`, the same function the assertion
         below uses. The waiter and the assertion can no longer disagree, because
         they are now the same code. If they ever report differently again, that
         is the product, not the instrument. */
