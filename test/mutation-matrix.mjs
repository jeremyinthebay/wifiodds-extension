// mutation-matrix.mjs — R23 binding addition #6: prove every honesty gate can
// FAIL. Runs phase2-e2e.mjs once per named mutation (E2E_MUT) with a focused
// E2E_ONLY case filter, and requires all three of:
//   (1) "MUTATION LANDED <name>" on stderr — the anchor still exists and the
//       regression was applied to the temp copy (a silently unapplied mutation
//       is a false pass; this project has been bitten by exactly that);
//   (2) a NONZERO gate exit;
//   (3) the FAIL line names the EXPECTED case — the right assertion caught it,
//       not an unrelated breakage.
// A mutation whose gate stays green is a broken instrument → this matrix exits 1.
// The CLEAN full run is phase2-e2e.mjs with no env. Release shape:
//     node test/phase2-e2e.mjs && node test/mutation-matrix.mjs
