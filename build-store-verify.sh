# build-store-verify.sh — FAIL-CLOSED, READ-ONLY release identity + copy gate.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (Codex round 20 P2). build-store-zip.sh REGENERATES the upload ZIP and file
# manifest from HEAD on every run, so it can only ever prove "the freshly built archive matches
# HEAD" — it can NEVER detect that the archive ALREADY COMMITTED in HEAD is stale. A one-byte
# committed source change with unchanged committed artifacts sails through it at exit 0.
#
# This gate reads ONLY committed bytes (git show HEAD:...) and writes NOTHING. It fails closed on
# any drift between the committed dist artifacts and HEAD:extension, and on any store-copy claim that
# contradicts the shipped manifest/product. The clean submitted SHA passes with no tracked changes;
# a committed one-byte source mutation with stale artifacts fails.
#
#   sh build-store-verify.sh     # exit 0 = committed artifacts + store copy match the shipped source
