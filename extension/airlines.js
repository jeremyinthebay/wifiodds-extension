/* airlines.js — static WiFi Streaming score map (v3.1, the segmented model)
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * PROVENANCE — this file started as a COPY of the browser extension's
 * `extension/airlines.js` (repo: jeremyinthebay/united-starlink-companion,
 * branch bridge-1.6). As of the v3 model this copy is AHEAD of the extension:
 * the extension has no segment data and is mirrored separately. If you change
 * one, change the other — until the `airlines` table in Supabase replaces both
 * (Phase B of wifiodds-infrastructure-plan.md). The site loads this as a plain
 * classic script: the top-level consts below become globals for the inline page
 * scripts, and the module.exports guard at the bottom is a no-op in a browser.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * A plain classic script (loaded by popup.html BEFORE popup.js) that defines
 * one global const WIFI_AIRLINES plus pure scoring helpers. It makes NO network
 * calls and touches no chrome.* API — it is a frozen snapshot of what was true
 * in July 2026, so it can be unit-tested straight from node.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE MODEL — a fleet is a list of segments, not a single system
 *
 * v2 scored one system per airline and dropped the rest of the fleet on the
 * floor. United came out 27 on the Starlink share and 27 on next-gen odds: the
 * same number printed twice, with 1,152 aircraft unaccounted for. Fifteen of
 * eighteen airlines had that problem.
 *
 * A segment is a count of aircraft, a system, and a price:
 *
 *   known    = Σ n over segments      (unresolved aircraft are NOT in the
 *                                      denominator — we exclude them rather
 *                                      than assume anything about them)
 *   share_i  = n_i / known
 *   floor    = Σ share_i × qMin(system_i) × free_i × 100
 *   ceiling  = Σ share_i × qMax(system_i) × free_i × 100
 *   nextGen  = Σ share_i × free_i × 100, over the Starlink and Amazon Leo rows
 *
 * qMin and qMax differ only where a segment names more than one possible system
 * and the split is unpublished. For a single-system segment the range collapses.
 *
 * THE PUBLISHED CONNECTSCORE IS THE FLOOR. It is the only value defensible
 * without an assumption, it errs toward the reader (overstating wifi is the
 * failure that strands someone), and range width tracks fleet heterogeneity, so
 * sorting by floor rewards fleet consistency. `ceiling` rides alongside and the
 * surfaces show it whenever the two differ.
 *
 * Next-gen odds stop being a second mystery number: they are the first row of
 * the same ledger, and /airlines/{key}/ prints the ledger.
 *
 * BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY. scoreEntry() still accepts a legacy single-system
 * entry with `system` + `equipped`/`fleet` (or `coverage`), so an airline with
 * no segment data keeps working and this landed incrementally. Every entry in
 * the July 2026 set now carries segments; the legacy path is exercised by
 * build/apitest.js against a synthetic entry.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE QUALITY WEIGHTS, ANCHORED TO OOKLA 2H 2025
 *
 * The old 1.0 / 0.6 / 0.3 scale was asserted. Ookla's provider medians and
 * tenth percentiles validate the shape and correct two of the values.
 *
 *   leo        1.00  median 212.68 Mbps, P10 63.71, 43 ms. Its tenth percentile
 *                    beats every rival's median, which justifies the ceiling
 *                    better than any adjective
 *   modernGeo  0.55  Viasat / Intelsat / Hughes / Thales / 2Ku: medians 42–58,
 *                    P10 14–28, about 740 ms
 *   legacyGeo  0.22  Panasonic / Inmarsat / SITA / Anuvu: medians 9–16, and a
 *                    P10 of 1.06–1.58 Mbps. The median is tolerable and the
 *                    bottom tenth is unusable; an expected value should say so
 *   atg        0.12  Gogo ATG-4, EAN: 0.1–0.8 Mbps per device, but 260–310 ms
 *                    and 75% of tests lossless
 *   none       0.00  no connectivity of any kind
 *
 * ATG is its own tier because it and legacy GEO are unlike in opposite
 * directions: an order of magnitude worse on throughput, three times better on
 * latency and loss. Messaging works, streaming cannot. The systems page says
 * that rather than hiding it in a shared bucket.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * RESOLUTION TIER — how the segments were sourced, stored per airline
 *
 *   tail       every segment from published per-tail data (United only)
 *   type       segments from a published fleet table by aircraft type
 *   systems    every system on the fleet is named, the counts are not
 *   announced  next-gen signed, nothing flying; segments describe today
 *
 * The spec called for deriving this. Only half of it is derivable: nothing in
 * the data says whether a count came from a tail registry or a press release.
 * So it is stored, and build/prerender.js asserts the half that IS derivable —
 * a tail- or type-resolved fleet cannot carry an unpublished split, so its
 * ceiling must equal its floor.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE THREE-TIER READING — TWO NUMBERS, NEVER ONE
 *
 *   nextGenScore  the headline. Odds of a NEXT-GEN system — Starlink or Amazon
 *                 Leo, the only two low-earth-orbit products flying — times
 *                 free-for-you. Delta is 0 here. A signed deal is still zero.
 *   serviceTier   what the fleet delivers TODAY, in three words:
 *                   next-gen   — LEO across (effectively) the whole fleet
 *                   streaming  — modern GEO fleetwide: Viasat / 2Ku / Hughes
 *                   basic      — legacy Panasonic / Ku. Email and messaging.
 *                   mixed      — part next-gen, the rest one of the above
 *   restTier      the tier on the part of the fleet that is NOT next-gen yet.
 *                 "unknown" renders as "streaming or basic".
 *
 * Both fields are DATA, not prose: the wording lives in the site/popup, the keys
 * live here, and build/prerender.js fails the build if a stored serviceTier
 * disagrees with the fleet share it is supposed to describe.
 *
 * We do not promise video calls anywhere. "Streams, uploads, real work" is the
 * claim the hardware supports; a Zoom call at 35,000 feet over a full cabin is
 * not something this data set can underwrite.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE PROJECTED SCORE — the number most likely to be misread, so it is fenced
 *
 * `projected` answers a different question from every field above it. Not what
 * a fleet is, but what an airline has signed for. Four carriers have committed
 * to a low-earth-orbit system that has not carried a single passenger yet.
 *
 *   projected = committed aircraft ÷ known fleet × 1.00 (LEO) × free-for-you
 *
 * That is the same denominator, the same quality weight and the same free factor
 * as nextGenScore, so the two sit on one axis: "Delta 0 today, 38 projected from
 * 2028" is a sentence a reader can check. Against a Streaming score it would not be.
 *
 * The committed count is the FLOOR of what was announced. "500+ Airbus" scores
 * 500, for the same reason the published Streaming score is the floor.
 *
 * FIVE FENCING RULES, each with a tripwire in build/prerender.js. A projection is
 * a promise somebody else made, and this file is where it could quietly turn into
 * a fact about an aircraft you are sitting in:
 *
 *   1. It sorts nothing. rankAirlines() ranks on today's floor, and the build
 *      asserts that deleting every projection changes no order and no score.
 *   2. It never takes the score arc. assets/site.css gives it a grey outline
 *      (.proj), and the build fails if a projected number ships inside an .sc-*
 *      element or a [data-band].
 *   3. The number never appears without its date. That is why projectionFor()
 *      returns a composed object (`parts` and `line`) instead of an integer, and
 *      why scoreAirline() carries no bare projected number anywhere.
 *   4. It always carries FIRM or SOFT.
 *   5. SLIPPED is COMPUTED from the build date and never stored. Once the
 *      announced start has passed with zero aircraft of the committed system
 *      flying, the confidence flips, the treatment greys out, and the original
 *      promised date keeps showing. A date that was missed should be louder than
 *      one that was met, and nobody should have to remember to make it so.
 *
 * Amazon Leo has no aircraft in the air and no passenger has measured it. A
 * projection is a share of a committed fleet. It is not a throughput claim, and
 * none of the strings below name a speed.

       France's own press release (corporate.airfrance.com, "Complimentary
       high-speed wifi now available on board Air France flights," 9 Sep 2025)
       gives NO fleet-wide aircraft count: only "30% of its fleet by the end
       of the year and throughout its fleet by the end of 2026," plus one
       dated figure, "the fifth aircraft in its fleet," as of that date. The
       only type-by-type breakdown in circulation (28/31 777-300ER, 45/56
       A220, 24/30 E190, 30/41 A350, 3/28 A320 -> 130 of 229) runs through One
       Mile at a Time back to stardrift.ai, a banned aggregator (rule 3) that
       was the sole origin of two already-corrected wrong numbers on this
       site. Same shape as the Qatar and ZIPAIR corrections: an aggregator
       figure with no publisher of record behind it.

       So there is no sourced replacement, in either direction: not 172, not
       130 off the aggregator route, and — the trap that bit SAS the same
       night — not 0 either. equippedPublished(entry) derives "is this count
       real" from the data shape (starlink named in no segment, unresolved
       aircraft present) exactly as it does for SAS, so every template on the
       site prints "count unpublished" instead of a number in either
       direction nobody can check. The panasonic segment (57 aircraft) is
       untouched — independent of the Starlink figure, keeps its own
       citation. serviceTier moves from "mixed" to "basic" for the same
       reason it did for SAS: with the starlink segment gone, nextGenShare is

       Business Travel News Europe." NO SOURCE FOUND for 60 as an installed
       count: it traces to SAS's own CCO, Paul Verhagen, telling Rhys Jones of
       Head for Points on a 15 Jan 2026 test flight that SAS "expected" 60
       A320s equipped "by May-ish this year." That is a dated, named-executive
       quote — it clears the aggregator bar — but it is a January PROJECTION
       for a May target, not a confirmed count. SAS's own 24 Mar 2026 release
       gives no aircraft figure, and no SAS interim report, investor update or
       fleet page from Feb–Jul 2026 gives one either. Today is six weeks past
       Verhagen's own target and nothing newer confirms it landed at 60, or at
       any other number.
       The other two rows are untouched — SAS's own wifi availability table
       (none, 45) and connectivity page (viasat/panasonic, 18) are independent
       of the Starlink figure and still support what they always did. What
       changes is the remainder: 123 − 45 − 18 = 60 aircraft whose Starlink
       status nobody has published moves to unresolved, excluded from the
       denominator rather than assumed equipped on the strength of a January
       guess.

       CORRECTED AGAIN 2026-07-26, same night. The first pass left
       `equipped: 0` on this entry, which every generic "N of fleet" template
       on the site read literally: the page shipped "0 of 123 SAS aircraft
       carry Starlink (0%)" beside a note saying Starlink launched on SAS
       24 Mar 2026. That is the same rule-1 violation the 60 was, in the
       opposite direction and worse, because 0 is a more definite claim than
       an unpublished count and it ranked SAS last of 18 on next-gen odds
       purely for lacking a number. `equippedPublished(entry)` now derives
       "is this primary-system count real or a placeholder" from the shape
       of the data (unresolved aircraft present, primary system absent from
       every segment) rather than from a hand-set flag, so scoreAirline()
       and every template built on it treat SAS's Starlink count as
       unpublished, not zero, and nextGenPublished(entry) keeps a false zero
       from outranking a real measured near-zero like British Airways'
       sourced 5 of 261. The raw `equipped: 0` below is never read directly
       by a render path any more; it survives only as the legacy shape the

       Q1 2026 8-K for it. The 8-K contains fleet COUNTS ONLY and says nothing
       about satellites. Two of the five types have a real source and three do
       not:
         A321ceo   ViaSat-1  Runway Girl Network, 2022-12-24 (one flight report)
         A220-300  ViaSat-2  Viasat contract release, 2019-08-07
         A320ceo   no published generation found
         A321neo   no published generation found
         A321LR    no published generation found
       The 2021 Viasat/JetBlue release names the A220-300 and A321LR together
       but gives a satellite generation for neither, so do NOT read the A220's
       ViaSat-2 across to the A321LR. A 2017 PaxEx report of a ViaSat-2 A320
       retrofit was never confirmed as completed and its own 2018 follow-up
       calls the timing "unclear". Do not restore a per-type split without a
       source that states it.

       Both generations are Viasat Ka, so they are one segment: the model
       scores the system, and the generation gap is a note. The E190s (the one
       sub-fleet with patchy Fly-Fi) were fully retired 2025-09-10. Amazon Leo
